# Cursor Project Rules: Clinic Static Website

## General Coding Standards
- Use **semantic HTML5** elements (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`) for structure.
- All CSS should follow **BEM naming convention**.
- Use **responsive design** with mobile-first approach (CSS `min-width` media queries).
- Prefer **vanilla CSS** or a lightweight framework (Tailwind, PicoCSS). No heavy UI libraries unless explicitly approved.
- Keep JavaScript minimal; only use when necessary for interactivity.
- All assets (CSS, JS, images) must be loaded from the local `/assets` directory unless otherwise approved.

## Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- All images must have **descriptive alt text**; decorative images should use empty `alt=""`.
- Ensure **sufficient color contrast** for text and backgrounds.
- Use **aria-labels** or semantic tags for all interactive elements.
- Form inputs must have **associated `<label>` elements**.
- All pages must be navigable via **keyboard only**.

## SEO Optimization
- Each page must have a unique `<title>` and `<meta name="description">`.
- Use `<h1>` once per page for the primary headline.
- Include **structured data (JSON-LD)** for "LocalBusiness" with clinic details.
- Optimize images using **WebP** or compressed formats.
- Generate a sitemap.xml and robots.txt.

## Performance
- Optimize images to be under **200 KB** where possible.
- Minimize CSS and JS; bundle and minify before deployment.
- Use async/defer for non-critical JS.
- Inline critical CSS for above-the-fold content.

## Content & Layout
- Site wireframes can be found in `.project/wireframe`
   - `landing.png`: is the landing page of the clinic website.
   - `about.png`: is the about page of the site, listing an overview of the clinic and its staff
   - `services.png`: expands on the services that are presented in the landing page
- Use Inner typography
