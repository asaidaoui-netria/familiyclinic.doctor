                                <p>
                                    Dr. Said-Alaoui Moulay Abdellah is a former military physician with over 40 years of
                                    experience at all levels of medical support, both national and international. As a
                                    family
                                    physician, he focuses on preventing lifestyle-related diseases. His experience with
                                    patients
                                    has given him sufficient perspective to understand the multitude of health problems
                                    that
                                    modern medicine still faces.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    By focusing on the nutritional and environmental causes of disease and what has
                                    become
                                    nutritional therapy, his approach is to provide patients, both healthy and sick,
                                    with clear
                                    scientific messages. He seeks to expand his patients' knowledge by helping them
                                    understand
                                    the causes of their illnesses. The nutritional advice he provides is thus easier to
                                    follow,
                                    and patients regularly report impressive and often rapid results.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    In doing so, he opens new perspectives for patients by powerfully contributing to
                                    what
                                    Hippocrates declared: "Let food be your medicine before your medicines become your
                                    food."
                                    Although questioning eating habits can sometimes be difficult to follow, patients
                                    respond
                                    positively to the natural care offered, whether preventive for healthy people or
                                    curative
                                    for people suffering from chronic diseases.

                                    course,
                                    and it is precisely the attentive follow-up that often produces unexpected results.
